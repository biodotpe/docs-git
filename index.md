# Open Microfluidics Workstation

The Open Microfluidics Workstation is a free and open-source workstation for high-throughput droplet microfluidic biological assays. This compact workstation is based on connectable, open, modern, and low-cost components (Rasberry Pi, Arduino, 3D printing, onboard components, open or at least accessible design software and operation software - python).

Find more about the workstation on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wenzel-lab/open-microfluidics-workstation/).
